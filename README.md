# twitdm
`twitdm` is a Twitter DM client that we're building to learn NodeJS and React and avoid wasting time on the TL.
It will consist of an API written in NodeJS and a web application written in React.
Since Twitter doesn't allow third party apps to read user DMs, this will have to run on your Heroku account and will only pull your DMs.
It will require you to log in with your Twitter username and password to access your DMs.

## Features
